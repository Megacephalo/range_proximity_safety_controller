# range_proximity_safety_controller
Range Proximity Safety Controller only needs laser scanning as input to act as a spontaneous safetyc controller depending on the detected ranges of the vehicle in relation to the robot. The project only depends on a single frontal laser range finder. However, it is possible to apply on rear laser scanner as well.
